PvPCraft is a high quality multipurpose bot. With features such as music, join-able ranks, moderation logging, pokemon lookup,
extremely configurable permissions, chess, minecraft commands, warframe, welcoming and giveaways.

All of pvpcraft's commands start off disabled and can be enabled by the `/perms` command. you can find out how on [docs](https://bot.pvpcraft.ca/docs)

PvPCraft was designed with the concept of configurability a it's heart. Almost every single command can be enabled and disabled in any scope you want.
You can allow all music commands then decide you want to limit just the force-skip command to moderators, or maybe lock music commands down to one channel.
Anything is possible with PvPCraft's advanced permission system.
